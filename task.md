# Task Description
In this challenge, you are required to make a Chrome Extension that is supposed to work **only** on the **Twitter** website. By clicking the extension icon, the extension will read the tweets presented in the timeline. After detecting **English** tweets, it will calculate the sentiment score of these tweets, and based on the score, it will show three emojis (üòä, üòê, ‚òπÔ∏è) **next to the date of the tweet**.

## Part 1
In the first part, you will make a web server with two REST API endpoints. Your REST API endpoints should use the exact **same method (POST) and URL** given below. Please deploy your web server to AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure.

### Language Detection API endpoint (POST /api/language-detection)
Body format is a JSON array with a number of JSON objects, each with the key ‚Äútweet_text‚Äù and the actual text of the tweet.
```
[
    {
        "tweet_text": "Stats on Twitter World Cup"
    },
    {
        "tweet_text": "As the saying goes, be careful what you wish, as you might get it"
    },
    {
        "tweet_text": "ÿ¥ÿ® €åŸÑÿØÿß ŸÖÿ®ÿßÿ±⁄©! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
    }
]
```
This API endpoint is supposed to return a boolean which determines if the tweet is English or not. You can use any off-the-shelf language detection NLP model, but you must integrate the language detection model with your web server. The output format can be like this:
```
[
    {
        "tweet_text": "Stats on Twitter World Cup",
        "is_english": true
    },
    {
        "tweet_text": "As the saying goes, be careful what you wish, as you might get it",
        "is_english": true
    },
    {
        "tweet_text": "ÿ¥ÿ® €åŸÑÿØÿß ŸÖÿ®ÿßÿ±⁄©! ‚ù§Ô∏è",
        "is_english": false
    }
]
```
**Note:** It is okay if your endpoint cannot detect other languages like Farsi in the example above, but it has to detect the English tweets correctly.

### Sentiment Score API endpoint (POST /api/sentiment-score)
Body format is a JSON array having ***only the English tweets*** detected in the last step:
```
[
    {
        "tweet_text": "Stats on Twitter World Cup"
    },
    {
        "tweet_text": "As the saying goes, be careful what you wish, as you might get it"
    }
]
```
This API endpoint is supposed to return the sentiment score related to each tweet, and also the final detected mood of the tweet. The output format can be like this:
```
[
    {
        "tweet_text": "Stats on Twitter World Cup",
        "sentiment_score": {
            "positive": 0.07268287241458893,
            "neutral": 0.863078773021698,
            "negative": 0.0642382949590683
        },
        "detected_mood": "NEUTRAL"
    },
    {
        "tweet_text": "As the saying goes, be careful what you wish, as you might get it",
        "sentiment_score": {
            "positive": 0.05127052217721939,
            "neutral": 0.7015827894210815,
            "negative": 0.24714668095111847
        },
        "detected_mood": "NEUTRAL"
    }
]
```
## Part 2
In this part, you should create a Chrome Extension with ***Manifest V3***. You can use the official documentation of the Chrome Developers website [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/).
Your extension is supposed to work ***only*** on the ***Twitter*** website. When on the Twitter website, the extension will be enabled by clicking the Chrome extension icon, and:
1. It will gather all tweet texts visible in the Twitter tab.

***Hint:*** Take a look at the DOM on the Twitter website and define a pattern to extract the tweet texts.
2. Sends all tweet texts to the language detection API endpoint.
3. After getting the response from the first API, it will ***filter*** the ***English tweets*** and sends them to the sentiment score API endpoint.
4. After getting the sentiment scores from the second endpoint, you must ***add one of the*** üòä, üòê, ‚òπÔ∏è emojis ***next to the date of the tweet***.

***Hint:*** You should manipulate the DOM and add the emoji as a new element with the ***same style*** as the tweet's date.
